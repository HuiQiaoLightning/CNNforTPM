A new GPU-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for tomographic phase microscopy (TPM).

The codes are implemented on Python (2.7.12) in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Keras 2.0.4 is utilized for the design of our CNN architecture. The version of TensorFlow is 1.4.1 and we use cuDNN v6.0.21 for CUDA 8.0. We perform the neural network computations on 4 NVIDIA TITAN Xp graphics cards.
