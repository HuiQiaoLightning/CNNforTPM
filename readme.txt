This is the implementation of the models and codes for the deep convolutional neural network based tomographic phase microscopy.

The code is implemented by Python (2.7.12) in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The version of TensorFlow is 1.2.1 and we use cuDNN v5.1 for CUDA 8.0. We perform the neural network computations on 4 NVIDIA TITAN Xp graphics cards.
